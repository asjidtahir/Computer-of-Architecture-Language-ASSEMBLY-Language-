[org 0x0100]      ; program to add 3 numbers using byte variable

mov  ax, [num1]   ;(program should do wrong || ax is 16 bit, db is 8 bit , so we can/t store db in ax)
mov [result], ax  ;we have to keep in mind that the label we use is fit with in register

mov ax, [num1 + 2]
add [result], ax

mov bx, [num1 + 4]
add [result], ax

mov ax, 0x4c00
int 0x21

num1: db 5, 10, 15  ; define_byte (program should wrong)
result: dw 0
